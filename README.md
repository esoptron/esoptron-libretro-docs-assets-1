Esoptron Libretro Docs Assets

I'm backing up Libretro/Docs webms and such here so I don't increase the repository size of libretro/docs

Libretro Team is free to do whatever they want with this repository

DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY TO THESE ASSETS ON THIS GITHUB REPO

GITHUB DOESN'T LIKE BEING USED AS A CDN

I HAVE UPLOADED THE WEBMS AND OTHERS TO SEPARATE IMAGE HOSTERS
