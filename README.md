Esoptron Libretro Docs Assets 1

I'm backing up Libretro/Docs webms and such here

DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY TO THESE ASSETS ON THIS GITHUB REPO
GITHUB DOESN'T LIKE BEING USED AS A CDN
UPLOAD THEM TO A SEPARATE IMAGE HOST LIKE LENSDUMP OR IMGCHEST AND LINK TO THEM INSTEAD.

Libretro Team is free to do whatever they want with this repository.

Collection of asset repositories (size limit of one repository seems to be 2gb):
